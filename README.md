I developed a functional calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator features a sleek, responsive design with a clean layout, ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices. JavaScript handles the core functionality, processing user inputs and displaying results in real time. This project showcases my ability to integrate interactive features with a visually appealing and efficient user interface, highlighting my frontend development skills and problem-solving abilities.
